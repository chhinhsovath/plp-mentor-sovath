# Security Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Nationwide Mentoring Platform backend to protect sensitive educational data and ensure compliance with security requirements.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. HTTPS/TLS Configuration

- **Production HTTPS**: Automatic HTTPS enforcement in production environment
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers including:
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
  - `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
  - `Strict-Transport-Security` with 1-year max-age
  - `Content-Security-Policy` with restrictive directives
  - `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

- **Server Information Hiding**: Removes `X-Powered-By` and server headers

### 2. Data Encryption

- **Encryption Service**: AES-256-CBC encryption for sensitive data
- **Key Management**: Secure key derivation using scrypt
- **Data Integrity**: HMAC-SHA256 for data integrity verification
- **Secure Token Generation**: Cryptographically secure random tokens
- **Password Hashing**: PBKDF2 with salt for password storage

### 3. Audit Logging

- **Comprehensive Logging**: All data access and modifications logged
- **User Activity Tracking**: Login/logout events and failed attempts
- **Risk Assessment**: Automatic risk level calculation for events
- **Data Export Tracking**: Monitoring of sensitive data exports
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit trail for compliance requirements

### 4. Rate Limiting and Request Validation

- **Endpoint-Specific Limits**: Different rate limits for different endpoints:
  - Authentication: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
  - API endpoints: 100 requests per minute
  - Export endpoints: 10 requests per 5 minutes
  - File uploads: 20 uploads per minute
  - Password reset: 3 attempts per hour

- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation including:
  - SQL injection prevention
  - XSS attack prevention
  - Strong password requirements
  - Safe file upload validation
  - HTML content sanitization

### 5. Secure Backup and Recovery

- **Encrypted Backups**: Database backups encrypted with AES-256
- **Automated Cleanup**: Old backups automatically removed based on retention policy
- **Backup Verification**: Integrity checking for backup files
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypted backup storage with separate encryption keys

### 6. Security Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive tests for encryption and security services
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end security testing
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Automated security testing for common vulnerabilities
- **Rate Limiting Tests**: Verification of rate limiting effectiveness

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Security Configuration
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-encryption-key-change-in-production-must-be-32-chars
SSL_CERT_PATH=/path/to/ssl/certificate.crt
SSL_KEY_PATH=/path/to/ssl/private.key

# Backup Security
BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-backup-encryption-key-change-in-production
BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS=30

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100
```

### SSL/TLS Setup

For production deployment, ensure SSL certificates are properly configured:

1. Obtain SSL certificates from a trusted CA
2. Set `SSL_CERT_PATH` and `SSL_KEY_PATH` environment variables
3. The application will automatically use HTTPS in production

### Database Security

- Use strong database passwords
- Enable SSL connections to database
- Implement database-level access controls
- Regular security updates for database software

## Security Best Practices

### Development

1. **Never commit secrets**: Use environment variables for all sensitive data
2. **Regular updates**: Keep dependencies updated for security patches
3. **Code review**: All security-related code should be reviewed
4. **Testing**: Run security tests before deployment

### Deployment

1. **Environment separation**: Use different keys for different environments
2. **Access control**: Limit server access to authorized personnel
3. **Monitoring**: Set up security monitoring and alerting
4. **Backup testing**: Regularly test backup and recovery procedures

### Monitoring

1. **Audit log review**: Regularly review audit logs for suspicious activity
2. **Failed login monitoring**: Monitor for brute force attacks
3. **Rate limit violations**: Track and investigate rate limit violations
4. **Security alerts**: Set up alerts for high-risk security events

## Incident Response

### Security Event Response

1. **Immediate containment**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact of security incident
3. **Notification**: Notify relevant stakeholders and authorities
4. **Recovery**: Restore systems from secure backups if necessary
5. **Post-incident review**: Analyze incident and improve security measures

### Backup Recovery

To restore from backup:

```bash
# List available backups
npm run backup:list

# Verify backup integrity
npm run backup:verify <backup-file>

# Restore from backup
npm run backup:restore <backup-file>
```

## Compliance

This implementation addresses the following security requirements:

- **Data Protection**: Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit
- **Access Control**: Role-based access with hierarchical permissions
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all data access and modifications
- **Incident Response**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities
- **Business Continuity**: Secure backup and recovery procedures
