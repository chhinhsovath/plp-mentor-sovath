# Production API URL - Using relative path for Vercel proxy
# Vercel will proxy /api/* requests to your backend
VITE_API_URL=/api/v1

# This way, API calls go through HTTPS (Vercel) to your HTTP backend

# Note: This will only work if your frontend is also served via HTTP
# If frontend is on HTTPS, browsers will block HTTP API calls
