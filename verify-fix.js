============================================

Based on the API response you provided:
- isActive: false
- status: "inactive"

‚úÖ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER OUR FIX:

1. USER LIST DISPLAY:
   - Should show: ‚ùå "Inactive" (red tag with CloseCircleOutlined icon)
   - Logic: record.isActive = false ‚Üí shows inactive tag

2. EDIT FORM DISPLAY:
   - Should show: Switch in OFF position (showing "Inactive")
   - Logic: form.setFieldsValue({ isActive: false }) ‚Üí switch shows OFF
   - No more hardcoded initialValue={true} override

üîß TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS:

1. Hard refresh the browser page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check browser dev tools console for any JavaScript errors
4. Check if the form.setFieldsValue() is being called with the correct data

üß™ TO TEST:
1. Open users page: http://localhost:5173/users  
2. Find teacher_demo in the list ‚Üí should show "Inactive" (red)
3. Click Edit on teacher_demo ‚Üí switch should be OFF
4. The status should now be consistent in both places!
