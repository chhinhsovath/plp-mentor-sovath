# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Nationwide Mentoring Platform is a comprehensive digital system designed to modernize and streamline teacher mentoring processes for the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MoEYS) in Cambodia. The platform will digitize paper-based observation forms for grades 1-6, automate feedback workflows, and provide role-based access to mentoring data across the national education hierarchy. The system aims to improve teaching quality through structured observation, feedback, and improvement planning while maintaining cultural and linguistic compatibility with Khmer language requirements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Digital Form Management System

**User Story:** As an educational observer, I want to access and complete digital observation forms specific to different grades and subjects, so that I can efficiently conduct standardized teacher evaluations without paper-based processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an observer logs into the system THEN the system SHALL display available observation forms filtered by their assigned grade levels and subjects
2. WHEN an observer selects a specific grade and subject combination THEN the system SHALL load the appropriate observation form template with relevant indicators and rubrics
3. WHEN an observer completes an observation form THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields before allowing submission
4. IF an observation form is partially completed THEN the system SHALL save the draft automatically and allow resumption later
5. WHEN an observation form is submitted THEN the system SHALL generate a unique session ID and timestamp for tracking

### Requirement 2: Role-Based Access Control and Hierarchy Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to implement hierarchical role-based permissions that reflect the MoEYS organizational structure, so that users can only access data and perform actions appropriate to their position and scope.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and determine their role and location scope within the hierarchy
2. WHEN a user attempts to view observation data THEN the system SHALL only display sessions within their authorized geographic or administrative scope
3. IF a user has management privileges THEN the system SHALL allow them to view and manage data for users in subordinate roles within their scope
4. WHEN a user with approval authority accesses pending missions THEN the system SHALL display items requiring their approval based on hierarchy rules
5. WHEN role permissions are updated THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect changes in user access without requiring re-login

### Requirement 3: Observation Session Workflow Management

**User Story:** As a teacher mentor, I want to conduct structured observation sessions with clear workflows for data collection, reflection, and improvement planning, so that I can provide consistent and actionable feedback to teachers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a new observation session THEN the system SHALL require selection of teacher, subject, grade level, and observation type
2. WHEN completing observation indicators THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate rubric scales (1-3 rating or checkbox) based on the indicator type
3. WHEN entering reflection data THEN the system SHALL provide structured fields for strengths, challenges, and recommendations
4. IF improvement areas are identified THEN the system SHALL automatically generate an improvement plan template for completion
5. WHEN an observation session is completed THEN the system SHALL require digital signatures from both observer and teacher before final submission

### Requirement 4: Improvement Planning and Follow-up Tracking

**User Story:** As an educational supervisor, I want to create, track, and monitor improvement plans resulting from observation sessions, so that I can ensure continuous professional development and measure teaching quality improvements over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an observation identifies improvement needs THEN the system SHALL create an improvement plan with specific goals, actions, and timelines
2. WHEN an improvement plan is created THEN the system SHALL assign follow-up activities with due dates and responsible parties
3. WHEN follow-up activities are due THEN the system SHALL send notifications to relevant stakeholders
4. WHEN reviewing improvement progress THEN the system SHALL display completion status and allow progress updates
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include improvement plan effectiveness metrics and completion rates

### Requirement 5: Multi-language Support and Localization

**User Story:** As a Cambodian educator, I want to use the platform in Khmer language with culturally appropriate interfaces, so that I can effectively navigate and use the system without language barriers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the platform THEN the system SHALL display all interface elements in Khmer by default
2. WHEN viewing observation forms THEN the system SHALL present indicators, rubrics, and instructions in Khmer
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL format dates, numbers, and text according to Cambodian conventions
4. IF alternative languages are needed THEN the system SHALL support language switching while maintaining data integrity
5. WHEN entering text data THEN the system SHALL properly handle Khmer Unicode characters and text input methods

### Requirement 6: Data Analytics and Reporting

**User Story:** As a district education officer, I want to access comprehensive analytics and reports on teaching quality trends, so that I can make informed decisions about resource allocation and professional development priorities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the analytics dashboard THEN the system SHALL display key performance indicators relevant to the user's role and scope
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by time period, geographic area, grade level, and subject
3. WHEN viewing trend analysis THEN the system SHALL present data visualizations showing improvement patterns over time
4. WHEN exporting reports THEN the system SHALL provide data in multiple formats (PDF, Excel, CSV) with proper Khmer text encoding
5. WHEN comparing performance metrics THEN the system SHALL enable benchmarking across schools, districts, or provinces within authorized scope

### Requirement 7: System Security and Data Protection

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure that all mentoring data is securely stored and transmitted with appropriate access controls, so that sensitive educational information is protected according to government data protection standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL use secure JWT tokens with appropriate expiration times
2. WHEN data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL encrypt all communications using HTTPS/TLS protocols
3. WHEN storing sensitive data THEN the system SHALL encrypt personally identifiable information at rest
4. WHEN audit trails are needed THEN the system SHALL log all data access and modification activities with user identification
5. WHEN data backup occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain secure, encrypted backups with appropriate retention policies

### Requirement 8: Mobile Compatibility and Offline Capability

**User Story:** As a field observer working in remote areas, I want to access and complete observation forms on mobile devices with limited internet connectivity, so that I can conduct observations regardless of network availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the platform on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive interface optimized for touch interaction
2. WHEN internet connectivity is limited THEN the system SHALL allow offline form completion with local data storage
3. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically synchronize offline data with the central database
4. WHEN working offline THEN the system SHALL provide clear indicators of sync status and data conflicts
5. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the system SHALL support device-specific features like camera integration for documentation
